    // To decide which algorithm is more efficient,
    // we will analyze the time complexity
    // and space complexity of both algorithms.

    // We will use asymptotic Analysis to compare 
    // the two algorithms.

    // Asymptotic analysis measures the order of
    // growth of an algorithm's running time or space
    // requirements in terms of the input size n.

    // Asymptotic Analysis doesnot depend upon
    // machine spcific constraints like CPU speed,
    // memory size, or programming language used.

    // Also it is theoretical analysis and doesnot
    // involve actual implementation of the algorithm.

    // Order of growth is the highest order term
    // in the time or space complexity expression.

    // Best case, average case and worst case
    // time complexities are used to analyze
    // the performance of an algorithm under different
    // input conditions.
